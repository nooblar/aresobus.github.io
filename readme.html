Hello ;) I hope you have a great day and smiling right now!
Because I'm just boring readme document and here you will found some short story about my
short life!
So I have two more pages near me, Index.html - just landing page of my future website,
I hope it will be much better.I skip parallax effect, reveals and etc, so there is just basic box model.
main.css - external css.... no webkits or any Java used, just CSS to have a nice good looking page
